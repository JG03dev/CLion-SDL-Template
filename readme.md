# SDL Template for Clion

----

This is a small template with a basic SDL initialization. 
This can be easily cloned to your project and start coding without any previous installation
(unless you want other packages aside from SDL and Linux pre-installed C libraries)

### Warning this only works (or at least has only been tested) on linux

## Installation

----

Follow [this guide](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/Installation) to install SDL in your system if you don't have it.

Clone this repository and use the CMakeLists.txt and main.cpp to your projects in order to have SDL fully functional.
```shell
git clone https://github.com/JG03dev/CLion-SDL-Template.git
```

Enjoy ;)
